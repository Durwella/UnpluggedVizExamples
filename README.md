# Durwella Unplugged Viz Examples

This is a Xamarin.Forms iOS app demonstrating the functionality of the [Unplugged Viz](http://unplugged.durwella.com) Xamarin component.
Component documentation can be found [here](http://unplugged.durwella.com/documentation/).

**Note**: Unplugged Viz requires a license for use - the app will not run without one.  If you would like a 14-day trial license, please contact unplugged@durwella.com, and place the license file in the `Resources` folder in the `DurwellaUnpluggedVizExamples` project.
There is also a more limited sample app included with the free trial version of the component available through the [Xamarin Component Store](https://components.xamarin.com/view/unplugged-viz).
